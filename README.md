# arduino_thermostat
This was my final project for one of my Computer Engineering classes.

BEFORE YOU START:

This project needs an Arduino Nano, an LCD, and a temperature sensor. 

The temperature sensor is hooked up to pin A0 with an analog reference of 3.3v


HOW TO UPLOAD TO YOUR ARDUINO: 

1. Download the zip file and extract it

2. Open up the project folder in Arduino

3. Go to Tools -> "Board: Arduino Nano" and "Processor: ATmega328P (Old Bootloader)"

4. Upload the code to your board and test it out!
